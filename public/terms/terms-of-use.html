<h2>5. ACCESS TO SERVICES</h2>
<p>Alpha5 makes no guarantee that the website will be uninterrupted or error free. Among other things, the operation and availability of the Alpha5 platform can be unpredictable and may from time to time be inaccessible. Alpha5 is not in any way responsible for any such interference that prevents your access or use of the Services.
	Alpha5 reserves the right to revise and/or discontinue any or all Services for any reason, without prior notice.
	You acknowledge, agree and understand that none of the Services amount to investment advice or any marketing, or promotion or offer of any product or investment to you or any third party. You are solely responsible for any losses, damages or costs resulting from your reliance on any data or information that Alpha5 may provide in connection with your use of the Services. You will make your own independent decision to access or use the Services.
	To the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, the Services and any product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of the Alpha5 are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis and the Alpha5 expressly disclaims, and you waive, any and all other warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title or non-infringement or warranties arising from course of performance, course of dealing or usage in trade. Without limiting the foregoing, the Alpha5 does not represent or warrant that the Services are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free, or free of viruses or other harmful components.
	Alpha5 will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the Services are available to you. However, access to the Services may be disrupted from time to time due to necessary maintenance, technical issues, network and system overloads or events outside of Alpha5’s control. Alpha5 will use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid downtime of the Services during anticipated peak hours, but assumes no liability (whether for trading-related losses or otherwise) if the Services or any part thereof are unavailable at any time or for any period.

<h2>6. DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS</h2>
<p>All deposits and withdrawals are subject to the limitations imposed by our KYC Policy. By making a deposit, you acknowledge and agree that your deposit is subject to those limits, and that you may be prevented from withdrawing BTC unless and until you complete verification and provide all required information and documents under the KYC Policy
	By providing and/or using a withdrawal address, you represent and warrant that you have full legal ownership and control over that address, and that your use of that address or the withdrawn BTC will not breach any applicable laws or regulations in any jurisdiction.
	All deposits, withdrawals and whitelisted addresses that you provide are subject to transaction monitoring, screening and blockchain analysis in order to detect any suspicious transactions. Alpha5 reserves the right to block or refuse to process any inbound deposit where we suspect the funds have originated from prohibited jurisdictions or sources associated with illegal or unlawful activity including bitcoin tumblers, coinjoin, laundries, darknet markets, illegal gambling, ransomware, money laundering or terrorism financing. Any such deposits will not be available for use on Alpha5. Where required by law, regulation or instruction from a government agency, Alpha5 will report suspicious transactions to the appropriate government agency including regulatory or law enforcement bodies.
	When you send bitcoin from an external address to your Alpha5 accounts, you are solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, including payment of sufficient network or miner’s fees in order for the transaction to be successful. Insufficient network fees may cause your deposit to remain in a pending state outside of our control and we are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions. Alpha5 retains the right to perform checks on inbound transactions including a sufficient block height of confirmations following the transactions, in Alpha5’s sole discretion. Alpha5 is not liable for any delays or consequential losses you may incur during confirmation of an inbound transaction</p>
<h2>7. TRADING ON ALPHA 5</h2>
<p>Alpha5 supports trading in a number of synthetic contracts that are based on a reference price of the underlying asset, BTC. 
	Trading of each contract is subject to the specifications of that contract. By placing an order for a contract, you represent and warrant that you have read and understand the specifications of the contract and the unique risks associated with trading the contract. 
	A detailed specification of each contract can be found at <a href="www.alpha5.io/markets-fees">www.alpha5.io/markets-fees</a>
	</p>
<h2>8. FEES</h2>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that, by using the Services, fees will apply. Current fees are set forth at <a href="www.alpha5.io/markets-fees">www.alpha5.io/markets-fees</a>
	Alpha5 retains the right to revise and update the applicable fees at any time at its sole discretion. Any such revision or updates to the fees will apply prospectively to any transactions that take place following the time that the updated fee is published.
	Alpha5 may offer differential fees and pricing models based on trade size, value, provision of liquidity or any other factor we determine. We may offer discounted fees and/or incentive payments to one or more market participants (“Designated Market Makers”) based on their contribution to market liquidity. 
	</p>
<h2>9. MARGIN REQUIREMENTS AND LIQUIDATIONS</h2>
<p>
	Trading on Alpha5 is subject to collateral and margining requirements.
	 It is your sole responsibility to ensure that your account meets these
	  requirements at all times. These requirements can be found at <a href="www.alpha5.io/margin">www.alpha5.io/margin</a>
Alpha 5 operates a unique portfolio margining system across your entire account, taking into consideration the value at risk associated with all open positions on all markets in your account. 
MARGIN REQUIREMENTS ARE DYNAMICALLY ADJUSTED TO RESPOND TO MARKET CONDITIONS, AND MAY CHANGE AT ANY TIME. ALPHA5 RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THE MARGIN REQUIREMENTS AT ANY TIME.
If at any time your account fails to meet the maintenance margin threshold, your position may be fully or partially liquidated. Alpha5 will use best efforts to liquidate your position in a way that maintains as much of your position as possible while ensuring your account once again meets or exceeds the maintenance margin threshold.
ALPHA 5 ACCEPTS NO LIABILITY AS A RESULT OF ANY CHANGE IN MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, ANY PARTIAL OR FULL LIQUIDATION, OPERATION OF THE LATE LIQUIDITY POOL AND INSURANCE FUND. IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT YOUR ACCOUNT IS SUFFICIENTLY COLLATERALIZED.
</p>
<h2>10. INSURANCE FUND</h2>
<p>The Insurance Fund is held by Alpha5 for the benefit of users, specifically to cover any margin shortfalls which are not covered by standard liquidation procedures.</p>
<p>For a position which falls to or below the necessary margin threshold:
</p>
<p>Alpha5 will fully liquidate the position on the market</p>
<ol><li>If the realized amount from fully liquidating a position still results in a shortfall, the balance will be taken from the insurance fund, up to 35% of the Insurance Fund’s total value.</li>
<li>If there is still a shortfall after applying the Insurance Fund, then the balance will be taken from the 50% of the traders with the highest realized and unrealized profit and loss across all of their positions in the past 24 hours, in equal proportions.</li></ol>
<p>Alpha5 reserves a certain trading fee for liquidations for the benefit of the Insurance Fund</p>
<p>The Insurance Fund is held for the benefit of the holders of Alph5 Token (A5T) at any given time. Alpha5 itself does not have any direct interest in the assets held in the Insurance Fund, except to the extent and in the capacity that Alpha5 holds A5T in its own right. Alpha5 will take all reasonable steps to ensure the security of the Insurance Fund and in no event will Alpha5 use the assets in the insurance fund for its own purposes.</p>
<!-- <h2>11. USING ALPHA5 TOKEN (A5T)</h2>
<p>Alpha5 offers the following benefits for holders of Alpha5 Token (A5T)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Upon successful registration, your account will be credited with 15 A5T.</li>
	<li>Upon successful registration of a new account from your referral, your account will be credited with 10 A5T, up to a maximum of 200 A5T.</li>
	<li>Any A5T that is credited at registration or through referrals will be locked and unable to be traded or withdrawn until you have traded $1,000 worth of notional volume per A5T. If you do not meet this requirement within 6 months of the A5T being credited to your account, you will forfeit any A5T that have not been unlocked by that time.</li>
	<li>If you hold at least 15 A5T in your Alpha5 wallet, you will receive reduced fee rates on both your maker and taker volume which may include increased rebates where applicable. The latest fees can be found at <a href="www.alpha5.io/markets-fees">www.alpha5.io/markets-fees</a> </li>
	<li>A5T represents a proportional share of the value of the Insurance Fund at any given time.</li>
	<li>You may redeem A5T directly from Alpha5 at any time for an amount equal to the proportional share, on a fully diluted basis, of the Insurance Fund</li>
	<li>Alpha5 will offer a market for trading A5T with no trading fees.</li>
</ul>
 <p>Alpha5 will spend 20% of monthly revenue to purchase A5T on the open market. All A5T purchased in this way will be burned. Alpha5 will not purchase more than 10% of the current supply for this purpose. The amount and value of each purchase, and proof that the tokens have been burned, will be disclosed following the purchase each month. </p>
<p>Apart from the initial issuance of A5T, Alpha5 does not control any aspect of the A5T supply or price. Alpha5 cannot arbitrarily or unilaterally issue or redeem any A5T. </p>
<p>Alpha5 reserves the right to increase or reduce the amount of A5T awarded to new accounts and/or the criteria for unlocking A5T at any time without prior notice. Alpha5 accepts no liability for any change in market price or value of A5T or any other loss you may incur from holding or using A5T.</p> -->

<h2>11. RISK DISCLOSURES</h2>
<p>Trading on Alpha5 may involve a number of risks, which may include the following risks. By trading on Alpha5 you represent and warrant that you are fully informed about these risks and accept full responsibility for any and all losses that you incur.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Trading Bitcoin may be inherently more risky that trading traditional financial instruments due to large potential market swings, price volatility, unanticipated technical changes, regulatory actions or other events that are unable to be controlled or predicted</li>
	<li>Leveraged trading increases the risk of significant financial losses due to magnified gains and losses</li>
	<li>Trading advanced financial instruments such as those offered by Alpha5 requires advanced knowledge of both the instruments themselves and the unique nature of markets on which they are traded. Further specific risk disclosures for each instrument can be found at <a href="www.alpha5.io/markets-fees">www.alpha5.io/markets-fees</a> </li>
	<li>
		Trading on margin requires in depth knowledge of margin and position requirements. In the event or a large market movement or if you fail to ensure you have adequate margin collateral in your account, you could lose up to the entire balance of funds in your account
	</li>
	<li>
		The reference price for each asset is determined by the price feed used by Alpha5. While Alpha5 makes every effort to ensure the integrity of price feeds, factors outside our control may lead to temporary departures from the underlying market price of Bitcoin on other exchanges. 
	</li>
	<li>Part or all of your profitable open positions may be taken in the event of a shortfall that is unable to be covered by the Late Liquidity Pool and Insurance Fund.</li>
</ul>
<h2>12. API ACCESS</h2>
<p>It is your responsibility to protect and secure all of your API keys. You agree that any trading or other instructions received or undertaken through your account are deemed to be final and conclusive, and that we may act upon such instructions without any liability or responsibility attached to it.
