What can I deposit on Alpha 5? Only Bitcoin at the moment. All of products right now are focused on the Bitcoin ecosystem. This will expand in the future. What can I trade on Alpha 5? Alpha5 offers variation on Bitcoin products, and will be continually evolving the product offering. As of right now, traders can use the XBTUSD Perpetual Swap, XBT Futures, XBT Futures Swaps. Parimutuel Options, and other products will be launched shortly thereafter. What fees are charged? For trading, Alpha5 has a very simple structure: 0bps for Makers 5bps for Takers Any order that does not immediately remove liquidity is classed as a Maker. In addition, in keeping line with industry standards: Futures Settlement: 5bps Liquidation Fees: 0.75% of order Withdrawals: None, except for dynamic minimum network fee. How do I make a deposit? Once on your account page, under deposits, you will see a wallet deposit address. Please be sure to send only to this address, and double-check if copy/pasted, that it is as displayed on your account. A QR code will also be provided. Alpha5 takes not responsibility for deposits not arriving. How do I make a withdrawal? It will be on the accounts section. Please ensure you are withdrawing BTC only to a supported BTC address. Alpha5 takes no responsibility for funds sent to incorrect addresses. Is there a minimum deposit and withdrawal amount? No. Is 2FA necessary? 2FA is not necessary, but it is strongly recommended. You are able to toggle your preferences from within your account. Is there KYC? Individual KYC is not mandatory at the moment, but we adhere to strong principles to avoid misuse of the platform. To be eligible you must accept our privacy policy, terms of use, and KYC Policy. You must NOT be a resident of the US or OFAC sanctioned nations. Alpha5 reserves the right to take any actions, including closure of accounts for violations of these policies. Are my funds secure? Yes. A vast majority are stored in multi-signature deep cold storage wallets. Only some funds are held in hot wallets at any time, and are replenished via a proprietary process. As withdrawals are only processed once daily, vectors of mishap are further significantly reduced. Trading What is Margin Trading? Margin Trading allows the use of leverage. This means that you may trade a higher notional value than what you have available. The amount of funds you have available tend to act as a collateral against the value of your position. What is Initial Margin and Maintenance Margin? The Initial Margin is the Margin required to open a position. This is a notional amount that is reserved for each account. It is calculated simply as: Notional Amount * 1/Leverage The leverage offered on Alpha5 is 25x. Example: A trader deposits 1,000 USDT. He wishes to open a position of long 10,000 USDT in the Perpetual Swap. The Initial Margin reserved would be: 10,000*1/25 = 400 USDT. Thus, of the 1,000 USDT deposited, 600 USDT would be the Available Balance. Initial Margin is reserved for all open positions and all open orders, except for orders that would reduce the any open positions (where no extra Initial Margin is reserved). Maintenance Margin is the amount of Margin that must be available at all times for a trader to keep full control over his/her account. Should the Maintenance Margin drop below a certain level, Alpha5 will begin to partially liquidate any open orders or positions to bring the account above the Maintenance Margin level. Maintenance Margin will simply be: Notional Amount * Maintenance Margin Threshold. On Alpha5 the threshold is 2% Example: A trader deposits 1000 USDT, and buys 10,000 USDT in the Perpetual Swap (as above). The Initial Margin reserved is 400 USDT. The MM is 200 USDT. Meaning if the account value drops to 200 USDT (10,000 * 2%), liquidations will commence. Further examples below with PnL will delineate the implications at various price points. What is Cross Margin? Alpha5 categorizes its margin implementation as Cross Margin. There are various iterations in the market, that are curated with different parameters. On Alpha5: IM on Perpetual Swaps and Futures is 4%. MM on the same products is 2%. Any Unrealized PnL is immediately available for use and is added to the Available Balance. IM is reserved on every position and on every order. However, any order that is created that would reduce a current position will not be charged IM. If an account falls below IM, but is still above the MM threshold, it is NOT subject to liquidation. However, in such an instance, a trader can only close positions/orders, or add capital. Below MM, the Alpha5 Risk Engine takes over the account of a trader in a bid to reduce account exposure to get Equity>MM. What is a liquidation? A liquidation occurs when an account\u2019s Equity < MM. At this point, a trader does not have control of their account, and Alpha5\u2019s Risk Engine will try to cancel orders and liquidate positions to try and bring Equity >MM. It is entirely possible that such efforts do not succeed and a trader has 0 Equity left, in which case they will be bankrupt. What is the relationship between Equity, Available Balance, and Firepower? Equity is the total value of the account at any given time. This includes the live PnL of any open positions. Available Balance is the amount of capital available for deployment. By definition this is the Equity less any IM. Available Balance will also usually be the same as the Withdrawal Balance. Firepower is a metric that lets you understand how much of your account value you are using; it is the Available Balance/Equity. The higher the number, the less your account value is being utilized, the more you are able to do. What are Futures Swaps? Futures Swaps are referred to by various names; futures spreads, calendar spreads, basis etc. At the end of the day, they represent the price differential between two different futures (or a perpetual swap and a future). Trading the instrument means you are buying one leg and selling the other. Trading Futures Swaps on Alpha5 can be done in a single-click, via a single instrument. None of the larger exchanges offer this instrument, though the benefits include: No price-execution risks Easy rolling of positions Increased liquidity and interest driven to the basis markets Reduced transaction costs Increased liquidity to futures markets It\u2019s important to understand that a Futures Swap is a \u2018look-through\u2019 instrument. Though you trade the instrument, your risk is reflected as two separate legs (either a future + future or future + perpetual swap). All risk management and margin management is done at the individual leg level. This leads to a simplified interface and risk calculation. How does Amplified Funding work? Unlike traditional funding rates, Alpha employs an Amplified Funding Rate, which is artificially made larger by a certain factor, to allow for larger notional settlement amounts. Users can always view the amplification factor on the top right-hand side of their trading dashboard. The funding rate displayed adjacent to it is the effective amplified funding rate. The core funding rate (to which the amplification factor has been applied) is a market determined rate, and is calculated using best practices across various venues. This Amplified Funding Rate is to be seen as an opportunity, allowing for cross-exchange arbitrage, and the ability to create new paradigms between funding trades. The funding market is already highly fragmented. By taking a known quantity, and changing it by a factor, there is more predictability and a more certain opportunity. If the funding rate is positive, longs will pay shorts, and if it is negative, shorts will pay longs. Funding payments will be tabulated as: Notional Position * Amplified Funding Rate. What is Mark Price? The Mark Price is the price at which the instrument was last measured for purposes of accounting and the risk system. It is typically most referred to in the calculation of Unrealized PnL. How do I calculate profit and loss? PnL is calculated for any position as follows: For a Long Position: Number of Contracts * (Exit Price \u2013 Entry Price) For a Short Position: Number of Contracts * (Entry Price- Exit Price) What is the difference between UPL and RPL? Realized PnL (RPL) is any PnL that has accrued from closed positions, trading fees, and funding fees. Unrealized PnL (UPL) is the running PnL of any open position. It is calibrated to the Mark Price of the instrument. Unrealized PnL is immediately available for use in the trader\u2019s Equity as part of Alpha5\u2019s cross margining offering.","title":"FAQs"},{"location":"FAQs/#faqs","text":"","title":"FAQs"},{"location":"FAQs/#basics","text":"","title":"Basics"},{"location":"FAQs/#how-long-does-it-take-to-open-an-account","text":"1 minute, maybe quicker, depending on how fast you can type.","title":"How long does it take to open an account?"},{"location":"FAQs/#what-can-i-deposit-on-alpha-5","text":"Only Bitcoin at the moment.

The current product availability consists of: Perpetual Swap Futures Futures Swaps Alpha5 XBT Index The calculation of the Index is taken from 5 different exchanges, namely Bitfinex, Binance, Huobi, OKEx, and Bittrex. Each exchange contributes a mid-price using their respective best bid and offer prices on a continuous basis. The highest-priced and lowest-priced exchanges are discarded for each calculation, and the other 3 are averaged to derive the A5XBT Index. In the event one or more of the constituent exchanges\u2019 price feeds is unavailable the average of 2 out of 4 or the mid of 1 out of 3 exchanges will be used to calculate the A5XBT Index. If there are only 2 constituents, both will be equally weighted, and if there is only a single feed available, that sole feed will be the A5XBT Index. In the event, no exchange feed is able to be used, trading will be temporarily halted until a connection is re-established with any one of the exchanges. Mark Prices The Mark Price is used for unrealised PnL calculation and liquidation purposes. Perpetual Swap: The Mark Price is dependent on the A5XBT Index and the Funding Rate. In the event the Perpetual Swap deviates more than 2.5% from the A5XBT Index, the Mark Price will be capped at the +/-2.5% deviation. Thus, Maximum value of Perpetual Swap Mark Price will be (1 + 2.5%) * A5XBT Index Price and Minimum value of Perpetual Swap Mark Price will be (1 - 2.5%) * A5XBT Index Price . Futures Contracts: The Mark Price of a futures contract is the average of the Best Bid Price and Best Ask Price, so long as such average is within a set field of parameters. The Maximum Deviation of the Mark Price for any Futures Contract from the A5XBT Index Price is capped at Dev = 2.5 + 30 * (Time to Expiry/365) per cent where Time to Expiry is the number of days left for the futures contract to expire. Thus, Maximum and Minimum deviations possible in the Mark Price of a futures contract are Mark Price (Max) = (1 + Dev) * A5XBT Index Price Mark Price (Min) = (1 - Dev) * A5XBT Index Price Futures Spreads: Any spread product\u2019s Mark Price will be the difference between the Mark Prices of its individual legs. Funding The Perpetual Swap will have a funding mechanism, which will attempt to anchor the price of the perpetual swap to the A5XBT Index. Every 8 hours, a settlement will occur as per the prevailing funding rate, during which funds will either be paid or collected by any user that has an open position in the Perpetual Swap contract at that time. Funding will happen 3 times a day at 00:00 UTC, 08:00 UTC, and 16:00 UTC. The funding a trader has to pay or will collect is calculated as: Funding = Position Value * Funding Rate Here Position Value is given as: Number of Contracts (in BTC) * A5XBT Index Price The Interest Rate is a highly varied figure. There is no consistent overnight cost of USD (or equivalent) and BTC in the industry, and hence this figure can be a fabrication, or a reliance on concentrated source(s). As a result, Alpha5 will look to amplify this figure, to create opportunities between varied rates across the industry. To do so, Alpha5 will reference the .XBTBON Index . The .XBTBON Index is now fixed at 0.03% per day. Alpha5 will be amplifying this value by 2, setting the Interest Rate permanently to 0.06% per day (i.e. 0.02% for every 8-hour cycle.) [I] = 0.02 % for all calculations. The Premium Index will be derived according to the following formula: Premium Index [P] = ((Max (0, Bid Price - Mark Price) \u2013 Max (0, Mark Price \u2013 Ask Price))/ALPHA5 (BTC/USDT) Index Price) + Funding Rate of Current Interval Where Mark Price is calculated as Funding Basis = Funding Rate of Current Interval * (Time Until Funding / Funding Interval) Mark Price = Index Price * (1 + Funding Basis) Funding Rate [F] = Premium Index [P] + clamp(Interest Rate [I] \u2013 Premium Index [P], 0.05%, -0.05%) Thus, if (I-P) is within +/- .05%, then F = P + (I-P) = I. If this is the case, F will equal I = 0.02% Note: Funding Rate Cap: (Initial Margin \u2013 Maintenance Margin) * 25% If the funding rate is positive, longs will pay shorts, and if it is negative, shorts will pay longs. Futures Expiration The Futures settlement price, is the price at which a Future expires. It is tabulated as the 30-minute time-weighted average from 07:30 to 08:00 UTC, with each instance being observed every 1 minute, for a total of 30 inputs into the expiration price calculation. Initial Margin The Initial Margin is the Margin required to open a position. This is a notional amount that is reserved for each account. It is calculated simply as: Notional Amount * 1/Leverage The leverage offered on Alpha5 is 25x. Example : A trader deposits 1,000 USDT. He wishes to open a position of long 10,000 USDT in the Perpetual Swap. The Initial Margin reserved would be: 10,000*1/25 = 400 USDT. Thus, of the 1,000 USDT deposited, 600 USDT would be the Available Balance. Initial Margin is reserved for all open positions and all open orders, except for orders that would reduce the any open positions (where no extra Initial Margin is reserved). Maintenance Margin Maintenance Margin is the amount of Margin that must be available at all times for a trader to keep full control over his/her portfolio. Should the Maintenance Margin drop below a certain level, Alpha5 will begin to partially liquidate any open orders or positions to bring the account above the Maintenance Margin level. Maintenance Margin will simply be: Notional Amount * Maintenance Margin Threshold. On Alpha5 the threshold is 2% Example: A trader deposits 1000 USDT, and buys 10,000 USDT in the Perpetual Swap (as above). The Initial Margin reserved is 400 USDT. The MM is 200 USDT. Meaning if the account value drops to 200 USDT (10,000 * 2%), liquidations will commence. Further examples below with PnL will delineate the implications at various price points. Profit and Loss All PnL is settled in BTC, and thus it is subject to inverse calculations. For any given trade, the PnL (before any trading fees) would be tabulated as: Number of Contracts (in BTC) * [Exit Price - Entry Price] Realized PnL Realized PnL is any PnL that has accrued from closed positions, funding and trading fees. Unrealized PnL Unrealized PnL is the running PnL of any open position. It is calibrated to the Mark Price of the instrument. Note : The Mark Price can be different at any given point in time from the rate at which the market is trading. Thus, it is entirely possible that the immediate opening of a position has a negative or positive PnL based on where the Mark Price is. Unrealized PnL is immediately available for use in the trader\u2019s Equity as part of Alpha5\u2019s portfolio margining offering. Average Entry Price & PnL Calculations Average Entry Price is obtained by dividing the total contract value in USDT by the Total number of contracts (in BTC). Total contract value in USDT = [(Number of Contracts1(BTC) * Price1) + (Number of Contracts2(BTC) * Price2) + (Number of Contracts3(BTC) * Price3)....] Please note that the average entry price for a position changes only if the position size is increased, not if it is reduced. Example : Suppose you enter a long position (buy) of 1 BTC contracts in BTCUSDT at $6000 You enter another long position of 1 BTC contracts in BTCUSDT at $5000 and another long position of 1 BTC contracts when BTCUSDT price is $7000 Now, Contract Value (in USDT) = 1 * 6000 + 1 * 5000 + 1 * 7000 = 18,000 USDT Total Amount (BTC)) = 1+1+1 = 3 BTC Average Entry Price = Total Contract Value/ Total Amount (BTC) = 18000/3 = $6000 Now suppose, after some days the Mark Price for BTCUSDT is $9050 You unrealised PnL will be calculated as follows Unrealised PnL = Total Amount (BTC) * [Mark Price - Average Entry Price] = 3*[9050 - 6000] = 9150 USDT Now, suppose you exit at $9000 by selling half your total position, i.e. 1.5 BTC contracts, then your Realised PnL will be calculated as follows Realised PnL = Amount (BTC) Sold for this Position * [Exit Price - Average Entry Price for this position] = 1.5 * [9000 - 6000] = 4500 USDT The average entry price remains unchanged at $6000 for the now net position of long 1.5 BTC contracts since the position was reduced with respect to the earlier scenario. Suppose you now buy another 1.5 BTC contracts when the market is at $10,000. Then, the new average entry price, since the position has increased, will be given by Now, Contract Value (in USDT) = 1.5 * 6000 + 1.5 * 10000 = 24,000 USDT Total Amount (BTC)) = 1.5 +1.5 = 3 BTC Average Entry Price = Total Contract Value/ Total Amount (BTC) = 24000/3 = $8000 Equity, Available Balance, and Firepower Equity is the total value of your account at any given point in time. It is checked by the liquidation engine to ensure compliance to the Margin thresholds. Available Balance is used to determine if there are sufficient funds for order placement. By definition: Available Balance = Equity \u2013 Initial Margin (IM) Example A trader deposits 1,000 USDT. That is their Equity. At the beginning, that is also their Available Balance. If they buy 10,000 USDT of Perpetual Swap, then with IM at 4% and fees of 0.05%, the Available Balance would be = 1,000 - .04*10,000 - .0005*10,000 = 595 USDT If opening any new order would require IM > Available Balance, the order will be rejected. Firepower, is displayed at the top of a trader\u2019s dashboard. It is an optical look at the percentage of capital of your portfolio that is available for use and is calculated as: Available Balance/Equity . The higher the figure, the more you are able to do with your account. Margin Notification, Calls, and Liquidations When a trader\u2019s account has its Equity < IM , a notification will be sent via email to let the trader know. At this juncture, the trader is unable to do place any orders that increase margin requirement. They are still able to sell any of their positions, close any open orders, or increase their account balance be way of depositing more BTC. If a trader\u2019s account has its Equity< MM , the Alpha5 Risk Engine will take over the trader\u2019s account. All open orders will be cancelled and the trader\u2019s positions will be sent to the market for liquidation, a process during which the trader will have no control of their account. This will continue until Equity> MM. Alpha5 charges 0.75% on liquidation orders. A trader can avoid liquidations by being prudent and employing effective risk management. This may include: Reducing Position Size Setting Stop-Loss Orders Depositing More Funds The Alpha5 Risk Engine will not try and market-sell the trader\u2019s entire position. Its intent is to create a continuous flow of smaller orders in an attempt to limit market impact, and to try and have Equity>MM to restore control to the trader. Insurance Fund Alpha5 operates an Insurance Fund that is capitalized by liquidation fees (see fees ). In the event the Risk Engine incurs a loss beyond the remaining Equity of the liquidated trader, the Insurance Fund will cover the difference. Because Alpha5 employs a lower leverage ratio (25x vs. 100x exchanges in the ecosystem), it would take repeated, large movements, to have to constantly utilize the Insurance Fund. Therefore, it is likely that the Insurance Fund would continue to be capitalized even if a few accounts had adverse outcomes. However, as a contingency, in any extraordinary circumstances, where the Insurance Fund is also depleted, a mechanism to socialize losses amongst profitable traders may be employed. Alpha5 will make efforts to predict such risks, and may revise margin requirements in an attempt to curb such outcomes. Notice of this will be provided. Implied Orderbook Logic One of the key features of Alpha5 is implied orderbook logic. This allows for the immediate combination of liquidity. For instance, if the XBT Perpetual Swap and June Futures Orderbooks had prices, Implied Orders (fully tradeable) would be created in the XBT Perp \u2013 Jun Fut swap; the price differential could be traded with a single click. There would be no risk of execution on a single-leg, and no hassle of manually managing a position. This logic, which is implemented on sophisticated legacy exchanges, serves as the bedrock for deepening the infrastructure of interest rate and futures markets. There are two-types of Implied Orders: In and Out Implied-In orders are as mentioned above. Prices of single futures legs are combined to create a price in a swap between them, synthetically. These prices adjust dynamically just as those futures adjust. Implied-Out orders go in reverse. Anyone that places an order in a swap (say XBT Perp- Jun Fut) will also be contributing orders into both the XBT Perpetual Swap and Jun Futures Orderbooks without any risk of being wrongfully executed. This logic is a key cornerstone of the Alpha5 offering and is deeply embedded into the risk engine. Cross Margin Alpha5 categorizes its margin implementation as Cross Margin. There are various iterations in the market, that are specified with different parameters. On Alpha5: IM on Perpetual Swaps and Futures if 4%. MM on the same products is 2% Any Unrealized PnL is immediately available for use and is added to the Available Balance. IM is reserved on every position and on every order. However, any order that is created that would reduce a current position will not be charged IM. If an account falls below IM, but is still above the MM threshold, it is NOT subject to liquidation. However, in such an instance, a trader can only close positions/orders, or add capital. Below MM, the Alpha5 Risk Engine takes over the account of a trader in a bid to reduce account exposure to get Equity>MM. Deposits & Withdrawals At any given point in time, a trader may request a withdrawal that is up their Withdrawal Balance. This will in most instances be equal to the Available Balance. As a function of a secure and complex storage process, Alpha5 processes withdrawals typically, directly from deep cold storage. As a result, there may be a lag on real-time withdrawals, though the team will endeavour to process all withdrawals as seamlessly as possible. Once you have requested a withdrawal, it is sent for approval. Post approval, the transaction will be broadcast to the Bitcoin network and you will receive your funds post the requisite number of confirmations on the Bitcoin blockchain. (* Note depending on the receiving wallet, the number of confirmations required may vary. This is not something Alpha5 controls ). Withdrawals can take longer in case the network mempool has a lot of traffic. You may always view the status of your transaction by tracking the transaction ID in a Bitcoin explorer. Please note that Alpha5 bears no responsibility for loss of funds if they are requested to be withdrawn to an incorrect address. The trader must take due care in all instances to ensure that the funds are being withdrawn to an address they intended, and that such address is indeed a compatible BTC address. Alpha5 Risk Engine Alpha5 operates an advanced risk measurement & liquidation process. Using a proprietary methodology, Alpha5 sends partial orders for liquidations, with the aim of incrementally increasing Equity >MM to preserve account balances and reinstate control of the account to the trader.","title":"Home"},{"location":"General/#general","text":"Alpha5 is a digital asset derivatives exchange offering a comprehensive suite of products for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

This logic, which is implemented on sophisticated legacy exchanges, serves as the bedrock for deepening the infrastructure of interest rate and futures markets. There are two-types of Implied Orders: In and Out Implied-In orders are as mentioned above. Prices of single futures legs are combined to create a price in a swap between them, synthetically. These prices adjust dynamically just as those futures adjust. Implied-Out orders go in reverse. Anyone that places an order in a swap (say XBT Perp- Jun Fut) will also be contributing orders into both the XBT Perpetual Swap and Jun Futures Orderbooks without any risk of being wrongfully executed. This logic is a key cornerstone of the Alpha5 offering and is deeply embedded into the risk engine.","title":"Implied Orderbook Logic"},{"location":"General/#cross-margin","text":"Alpha5 categorizes its margin implementation as Cross Margin. There are various iterations in the market, that are specified with different parameters. On Alpha5: IM on Perpetual Swaps and Futures if 4%. MM on the same products is 2% Any Unrealized PnL is immediately available for use and is added to the Available Balance. IM is reserved on every position and on every order. However, any order that is created that would reduce a current position will not be charged IM. If an account falls below IM, but is still above the MM threshold, it is NOT subject to liquidation. However, in such an instance, a trader can only close positions/orders, or add capital.

Limit These are orders that specify a particular level at which a trader is willing to buy or sell. By definition, a Buy-Limit order is at or below the prevailing market price, and a Sell-Limit order is at or above the prevailing market price. These orders are only executed when other trader(s) elects to execute at such prices. A Limit order cannot have a worse fill than the one input, but at times of high volatility, it is sometimes possible that a Limit order is executed at a better price than intended. This is due to numerous factors, including manual lead-times for input of orders. Stop or Stop-Market Stop & Stop-Market names are used interchangeably at times. Both denote the desire to either: Buy at a rate above the current market or Sell at a rate below the current market A Stop Order is typically entered to limit losses. If a trader is short, and the market is rising, a stop-order will convey a level at which the trader wishes to exit that position. Likewise, if a trader is long, and the market is falling, a stop-order will convey a level at which the trader wishes to exit that position. Note that Stop or Stop-Market orders have an element of slippage. This means that though you have input a particular level to exit the position; it is a trigger level (on Alpha5 you can pick the Trigger to be the Last Traded Price, Mark Price, or the Index Price), and the actual execution may differ. At times of high volatility, the actual execution rate may be very different to the Stop or Stop-Market Rate. Stop Limit A Stop-Limit order combines elements of a Stop Order and a Limit Order. With this Order type, when a particular market level is reached, a Limit Order is created. This is sometimes done to limit the slippage mentioned in Stop Orders. That is, a trader that is short XBTUSD at $10,000 enters a Stop-Limit order with a Stop-Price of $11,000 and Limit Price of $10,850. In this instance, if the market goes to $11,000, the trader\u2019s position is NOT closed. Instead, a Limit order is created to buy XBTUSD back at $10,850. * Note that with this type of order there is no guaranteed fill. In the above instance, it is very likely that the market continues to move materially higher once $11,000 is triggered. If so, the trader\u2019s entire account would be at risk. Trailing-Stop (Coming Soon) A Trailing-Stop order is used often to protect the PnL accrued in a position, but without closing it out at that time. In this order, a Trail Price is identified and if the market falls back a certain amount, a Stop-Order is immediately created and executed. If a Trader is Long, they can create a Trailing-Stop to see if the market will continue to rise; the Trail Price will rise with the market ( like a shadow ). And if the market retraces to the Trail Price at a given point, a Stop-Order will allow them to exit the position. Bracket (Coming Soon) A Bracket order has a main order, and 2 conditional orders around it ( A Limit and a Stop order ). This type of order helps define an entire trade. For instance, if a Trader creates an order to buy at $10,500 with a Bracket stop-loss at $9,800 and Limit sell at $12,500, he/she has pre-defined their maximum loss/gain prior to entering the trade. Post-Only (Coming Soon) A Post-Only order ensures that a Limit Order is not immediately executed. Sometimes, as the market moves very quickly, it is possible that by the time a Limit Order is placed, it is immediately executed. This can sometimes have the consequences of being a Taker and paying the Taker Fee. However, with a Post-Only order, the order will only post if it ensures that at the time of entry, the order will not remove immediate liquidity from the market and will benefit from being a Maker and paying 0 fees. Iceberg (Coming Soon) With an Iceberg order, a larger order is automatically divided into smaller orders so that actual order quantity remains hidden; much like an iceberg, only a small amount is visible at all times, although the entire order stands valid.","title":"Order Types"},{"location":"Order%20Types/#order-types","text":"Alpha5 will allow for the following type of orders:","title":"Order Types"},{"location":"Order%20Types/#market","text":"These are orders that are sent to market for immediate execution at the prevailing market price.","title":"Market"},{"location":"Order%20Types/#limit","text":"These are orders that specify a particular level at which a trader is willing to buy or sell.

It is also similar to a future in that it can diverge from the spot price (largely due to the leverage), but it does not have an expiration. To ensure that a Perpetual Swap mimics as close to a spot price (A5XBT Index) as possible, a Funding Rate is used. Generally speaking, continued periods of Perpetual Swap trading over the Index will lead to a higher (positive) funding rate, whereby longs are charged for the benefit of the shorts (who receive funding payments). Likewise, when the Perpetual Swap trades for a sustained period below the Index, longs will receive funding payments at the expense of shorts. Every 8 hours, a settlement will occur as per the prevailing funding rate, during which funds will either be paid or collected by any user that has an open position in the Perpetual Swap contract at that time. Funding will happen 3 times a day at 00:00 UTC, 08:00 UTC, and 16:00 UTC. The funding a trader has to pay or will collect is calculated as: Funding = Position Value * Funding Rate Here Position Value is given as: Number of Contracts (in BTC) * A5XBT Index Price If the rate is positive, longs (buyers) will pay the shorts (sellers). If the rate is negative, the shorts pay the longs. Funding is a net-zero operation for the exchange; it is payments being exchanged between buyers and sellers. The notification for funding paid/received shows under the Transaction History tab. Funding Rate Calculation A predictive funding rate for the next 8-hour cycle will be calculated every minute over the current 8-hour cycle. At the end of each cycle, a time-weighted average of the 480 predictive funding rate values (one value for each minute over an 8-hour interval) will be calculated, becoming the Funding Rate for the new cycle. Predictive Funding Rate calculations: The Funding Rate will have 2 components: The Interest Rate [I] and the Premium Index [P] The Interest Rate is a highly varied figure. There is no consistent overnight cost of USD (or equivalent) and BTC in the industry, and hence this figure can be a fabrication, or a reliance on concentrated source(s). As a result, Alpha5 will look to amplify this figure, to create opportunities between varied rates across the industry. To do so, Alpha5 will reference the .XBTBON Index . The .XBTBON Index is now fixed at 0.03% per day. Alpha5 will be amplifying this value by 2, setting the Interest Rate permanently to 0.06% per day (i.e. 0.02% for every 8-hour cycle.) [I] = 0.02 % for all calculations. The Premium Index will be derived according to the following formula: Premium Index [P] = ((Max (0, Bid Price - Mark Price) \u2013 Max (0, Mark Price \u2013 Ask Price))/ALPHA5 (BTC/USDT) Index Price) + Funding Rate of Current Interval Where Mark Price is calculated as Funding Basis = Funding Rate of Current Interval * (Time Until Funding / Funding Interval) Mark Price = Index Price * (1 + Funding Basis) Funding Rate [F] = Premium Index [P] + clamp(Interest Rate [I] \u2013 Premium Index [P], 0.05%, -0.05%) Thus, if (I-P) is within +/- .05%, then F = P + (I-P) = I. If this is the case, F will equal I = 0.02% Note: Funding Rate Cap: (Initial Margin \u2013 Maintenance Margin) * 25% Example Ex-i(a) Let Bid Price = 9675 USDT Ask Price = 9676 USDT BTC/USDT Index Price = 9671 USDT Funding Rate of Current Interval = 0.01% Time Until Funding = 4 hours Then, Mark Price: Funding Basis = 0.01% * (4/8) = 0.005% or 0.00005 Mark Price = 9671 * (1+0.00005) = 9671.48 Premium Index [P] = ((Max (0, 9675 - 9671.48) \u2013 Max (0, 9671.48 \u2013 9676))/9671) + 0.01% = (3.52/9671) + 0.0001 = 0.00036 + 0.0001 = 0.00046 or 0.046% Funding Rate [F] = 0.046% + clamp(0.02% \u2013 0.046%, 0.05%, -0.50%) = 0.046% + clamp(-0.026%, 0.05%, -0.05%) = 0.046% \u2013 0.026% = 0.02% Since, -.05% \u2264 (I-P) \u2264+.05% for this F, F = I = 0.02% Ex-i(b) Let Bid Price = 9675 USDT Ask Price = 9676 USDT BTC/USDT Index Price = 9686 USDT Funding Rate of Current Interval = -0.08% Time Until Funding = 6 hours Then, Mark Price: Funding Basis = -0.08% * (6/8) = -0.06% or -0.0006 Mark Price = 9686 * (1-0.0006) = 9680.19 Premium Index [P] = ((Max (0, 9675 - 9680.19) \u2013 Max (0, 9680.19 \u2013 9676))/9686) - 0.08% = (-4.19/9686) - 0.0008 = -0.00043 - 0.0008 = -0.00123 or -0.123% Funding Rate [F] = -0.123% + clamp(0.02% \u2013 (-0.123%), 0.05%, -0.05%) = -0.123% + clamp(0.143%, 0.05%, -0.05%) = -0.123% + 0.05% = -0.073% In this case, F is as is since I - P > 0.05% Ex-ii It is 09:00.
